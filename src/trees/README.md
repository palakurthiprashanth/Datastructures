## Trees

DS like arrays, linked lkist , Stacks, Queues follow linear data structure but Trees follow hierarchical DS.

Trees can be formed by group of nodes linked together to simulate hiererchy

Trees are Uni-directional.

## Terminology

1. Root Node.
2. Parent Node.
3. Child Node.
4. Leaf Node / External Nodes.
5. Non- leaf Node / Internal Nodes.
6. Path - sequence of edges from source to destination.
7. Ancestor Node - Any precesor [ previous node] in that path
8. Descesant Node - Any succesor [ next nodes] in path from that node to leaf.
9. Sibling Node.
10. Degree - No of Children of a node, Max degree of any node in tree is degree of a tree.
11. Depth - No of edges from root to that node.Depth of root node is 0
12. Height - From bottom , height of tree is height of root node.
13. Level - each step of hierarchy , level of tree = height of tree.

In a tree for n nodes there will be n-1 edges , if we add one more edge it will become cycle, tree will not have cycle.

## Applications

File system, Hierarchy systems.
