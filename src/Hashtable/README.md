## Hashing

In linear DS , time complexity for storing is O(n) , and in binary DS it is O(logn).
There should be a way , where searching takes place in constant time irrespective
of length.

In hashing search takes constant time.

Hashing is process of storing object according to unique key.

It stores values in key-value pairs.Key is unique.

The concept of hashing has given birth to several new data structures, but the most prominent one is the hash table.

## Hash Tables

If algorithm prioritizes the search operations then Hash Tables are best.

Hash tables implement using Arrays as accessing takes const time.

Performance of hash table depends on

1. Hash function
2. size of hash table
3. collision method.
